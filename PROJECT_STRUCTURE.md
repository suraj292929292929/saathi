## 🎨 Customization

### Styling
- Modify `styles/main.css` to change colors, animations, or layout
- Neon color classes: `.neon-blue`, `.neon-green`, `.neon-yellow`, `.neon-purple`
- Animation classes: `.fade-in`, `.slide-up`, `.hover-glow`, `.pulse-glow`

### Data
- Update `data/sampleData.js` to modify sample content
- Add new subjects, doubts, users, or notifications

### Components
- Each component is self-contained in the `components/` folder
- Add new features by creating additional component files
- Import new components in `main.html`

## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Components
1. Create a new `.js` file in the `components/` folder
2. Write your React component using JSX
3. Add the script tag to `main.html`
4. Import and use in the appropriate parent component

### Modifying Existing Components
- Each component handles its own state and logic
- Props are passed down from parent components
- Use the existing design patterns for consistency

### Data Management
- Currently uses local state and sample data
- Can be easily extended to use APIs or databases
- State management is handled at the component level

## 🌟 Key Components Overview

### App.js
- Main application router and state manager
- Handles authentication and page navigation
- Manages global application state

### Navigation.js
- Responsive navigation bar with mobile menu
- User dropdown with notifications
- Active page highlighting

### Dashboard.js
- Main feed of doubts with search and filtering
- Statistics cards showing user progress
- Interactive doubt cards with actions

### Profile.js

## 📊 Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed
- **Optimized Animations**: CSS transforms for smooth performance
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only essential libraries included
- **Efficient Rendering**: React's virtual DOM for optimal updates

## 🔒 Security Notes

- This is a demo application with mock authentication
- For production use, implement proper authentication
- Sanitize user inputs and validate data
- Use HTTPS and secure API endpoints
